        Do you have a <b>book you love so much</b> you'd like to give it to the world?  These are the books that <span class="ungluer"></span> is helping to give to the world, right now.
    </p>
    <p>
		<span class="ungluer"></span> wants everyone to be able to read these books -- for free, on their favorite devices, worldwide -- but also wants the book's creators to be paid.  Traditionally, readers pay each time they buy a book.  But what if it worked more like public radio?  What if creators got enough money to cover their costs and make their efforts worthwhile, and then the book were free to all?  That's what Unglue.it does.  Creators decide what fee makes sense to them, and then, through campaigns at Unglue.it, people everywhere chip in -- people like <span class="ungluer"></span>.
    </p>
    <p>
    	These books have active campaigns running, right now.  Ungluers like <span class="ungluer"></span> are pledging to unglue them, with no risk; their credit cards will only be charged if the campaign succeeds.  And when that happens, these books will be free for you, and everyone else, to read and share.
    </p>
    <p>
        What if your favorite book were on this list?

        What if you could <b>unglue it</b>?
