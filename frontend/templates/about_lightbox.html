			<b>What if you could</b> buy an ebook and read it on any device, in any format, forever?  What if you could give an ebook to your library, for them to share?  What if you could have DRM-free ebooks, legally?  What if you could have free ebooks, and know their creators had been fairly paid?
		</p>
		<p>
			At Unglue.it, you can pledge toward creating ebooks that will be legally free, worldwide.  These books have already been traditionally published, but they're stuck: legal restrictions keep you from being able to enjoy and share them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unglue.it gets them unstuck.  We work with authors and publishers to choose a fair licensing fee.  When we raise that money here through crowdfunding -- people like you chipping in --  the rights holders get paid, and they issue a free electronic edition under a <a href=http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> license.
		</p>
		<p>
			What if you could buy a book for yourself -- and give a copy to everyone on earth?
