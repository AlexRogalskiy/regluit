<h3>How It Works</h3>
<dt>What is Unglue.It?</dt>

<dd>TBA</dd>

<dt>What is Crowdfunding?</dt>

<dd>Crowdfunding is working together to support something you believe in.  By pooling donations, big and small, from all over the world, we can make huge things happen.</dd>

<dt>What does it cost?</dt>

<dd>Unglue.It is free to join.  Most of the things you can do here -- discovering books, adding them them to your wishlist, commenting, sharing -- are free too.  If you choose to support a campaign, you may pledge whatever amount you're comfortable with.<br /><br />

If you're a rights holder, starting campaigns is free, too.  You only pay Unglue.It if your campaign succeeds.  For more details, see the FAQs on <a href="/faq/starting/">Starting a Campaign</a>.</dd>

<dt>Who can use Unglue.It?</dt>

<dd>Anyone!  We're located in the United States, but we welcome participants from all over the world.<br /><br />

To fund a campaign, you'll need a valid credit card.  To start a campaign, you'll need to establish yourself with us as a rights holder, including demonstrating that you have the rights to the content you want to unglue.  See the FAQs on <a href="/faq/starting/">Starting a Campaign</a> for more.</dd>

<dt>Does Unglue.It own the copyright of unglued books?</dt>

<dd>No.  When you unglue a book, the copyright stays with its current owner.<br /><br />

Ungluing involves licensing rights, just like traditional publishing transactions.  We use <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> licenses to make ebooks available to the world while respecting and protecting copyright.<br /><br />

If you are a copyright holder, you will retain your copyright when you unglue a book.  CC licenses are non-exclusive, so you also retain the right to enter into separate licensing agreements.  You can read more about these licenses at the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Frequently_Asked_Questions">Creative Commons FAQ</a>.</dd>

<dt>Is there a widget that can be put on my own site to share my favorite books or campaigns?</dt>

<dd>Yes!  Every book page has an "Embed" option.  Click that and copy/paste the HTML code wherever you like.</dd>

<dt>I know a book that should be unglued.</dt>

<dd>Great! Find it in our database (using the search box above) and add it to your wishlist, so we know it should be on our list, too.  You can also contact us: <!-- info? --></dd>

<dt>I know a book that should be unglued, and I own its electronic rights.</dt>

<dd>Fabulous!  Please refer to the <a href="/stub/rhfaq">Rights Holder FAQ</a> and then contact us.</dd><!-- which contact info? -->

<dt>How much does a book cost?</dt>
 
<dd>The author or publisher set a price for giving the book to the world. Once you and your fellow ungluers raise enough money to meet that price, the Unglued ebook is available at no charge, for everyone, everywhere!</dd>
 
<dt>Are the unglued ebooks compatible with my reader?</dt>
 
<dd>Unglued ebooks are distributed with NO DRM, so they'll work on Kindle, iPad, Kobo, Mac, Windows, Linux... you get the idea.  And if the ePub format isn't best for your device, you're free to shift unglued books to a format that works better for you.</dd>

<dt>Why does it say a book's campaign has been suspended or withdrawn?</dt>

<dd>If there is a dispute between Gluejar and the book's rights holder, or if we discover evidence that a book's rights are in dispute after launching a campaign, it may be necessary for us to withdraw or suspend the campaign.</dd>

<dt>If I pledged to a suspended or withdrawn campaign, what happens to my pledge?</dt>

<dd>Your pledge will time out according to its original time limit.  If the campaign is resolved and reactivated before your pledge has timed out, your pledge will become active again.  If the campaign is not reactivated before your pledge's time limit, your pledge will expire and you will not be charged.  As always, you will only be charged if a campaign is successful, within its original time limit.</dd>

<dt>What if I want to change or cancel a pledge?</dt>

<dt>Does Gluejar help to fund self-published books?</dt>

<dd>No.</dd><!-- should we provide pointers to other resources? encourage people to CC-license their own works?-->
