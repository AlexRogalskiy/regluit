<dt>I know a book that should be unglued.</dt>

<dd>Great! Find it in our database (using the search box above) and add it to your wishlist, so we know it should be on our list, too.  You can also contact us: <!-- info? --></dd>

<dt>I know a book that should be unglued, and I own its electronic rights.</dt>

<dd>Fabulous!  Please refer to the <a href="/stub/rhfaq">Rights Holder FAQ</a> and then contact us.</dd><!-- which contact info? -->

<dt>How much does a book cost?</dt>
 
<dd>The author or publisher set a price for giving the book to the world. Once you and your fellow ungluers raise enough money to meet that price, the Unglued ebook is available at no charge, for everyone, everywhere!</dd>
 
<dt>Are the unglued ebooks compatible with my reader?</dt>
 
<dd>Unglued ebooks are distributed with NO DRM, so they'll work on Kindle, iPad, Kobo, Mac, Windows, Linux... you get the idea.  And if the ePub format isn't best for your device, you're free to shift unglued books to a format that works better for you.</dd>

<dt>Why does it say a book's campaign has been suspended or withdrawn?</dt>

<dd>If there is a dispute between Gluejar and the book's rights holder, or if we discover evidence that a book's rights are in dispute after launching a campaign, it may be necessary for us to withdraw or suspend the campaign.</dd>

<dt>If I pledged to a suspended or withdrawn campaign, what happens to my pledge?</dt>

<dd>Your pledge will time out according to its original time limit.  If the campaign is resolved and reactivated before your pledge has timed out, your pledge will become active again.  If the campaign is not reactivated before your pledge's time limit, your pledge will expire and you will not be charged.  As always, you will only be charged if a campaign is successful, within its original time limit.</dd>

<dt>What if I want to change or cancel a pledge?</dt>

<dt>Does Gluejar help to fund self-published books?</dt>

<dd>No.</dd><!-- should we provide pointers to other resources? encourage people to CC-license their own works?-->
