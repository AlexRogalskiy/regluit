You shall never use another user’s account without such other user’s express permission. You will immediately notify Company in writing of any unauthorized use of your account, or other account related security breach of which you are aware.</p>

<a id="use"><h3>Use of the Service</h3></a>

<p>Except as allowed by a Platform Services Agreement for Rights Holders, the Service is provided only for your personal, non-commercial use.  You are responsible for all of your activity in connection with the Service.</p>

</ul>

<p>You acknowledge that all Content accessed by you using the Service is at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss resulting therefrom.</p>

<a id="thirdparty"><h3>Third Party Content</h3></a>

<p>The Service may contain links to other websites or services not controlled by Unglue.it, and other websites or resources may contain links to the Site. When you access third party websites, you do so at your own risk. These other websites are not under Company's control, and you acknowledge that Company is not responsible or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of such websites or resources. The inclusion of any such link does not imply endorsement by Company or any association with its operators. You further acknowledge and agree that Company shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such Content, goods or services available on or through any such website or resource.</p>

<a id="fundraising"><h3>Campaigns: Fund-Raising and Commerce</h3></a>

<p>Unglue.it is a venue for fund-raising and commerce. Unglue.it allows certain users ("Rights Holders") to list campaigns and raise funds from other users ("Supporters"). All funds are collected for Rights Holders by Paypal.  </p>

<p>Unglue.it shall not be liable for your interactions with any organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Service. This includes, but is not limited to, delivery of goods and services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with campaigns on Unglue.it. Unglue.it is not responsible for any damage or loss incurred as a result of any such dealings. All dealings are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. Unglue.it is under no obligation to become involved in disputes between Supporters and Rights Holders, or between site members and any third party. In the event of a dispute, you release Unglue.it, its officers, employees, agents and successors in rights from claims, damages and demands of every kind, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and our Service.</p>

<a id="supporting"><h3>Supporting a Campaign</h3></a>

<p>Joining Unglue.it is free.  However, Unglue.it may provide you the opportunity to make Donations or Pledges (collectively, Contributions) to Campaigns on the Service. You may contribute to any active Campaign in any amount you choose, subject to limitation imposed by payment processors such as PayPal. You may contribute to as many Campaigns as you like.</p>

<p>It is solely your choice to contribute to a Campaign. You understand that making a Contribution to a Project does not give you any rights in or to that Campaign or its associated work(s), including without limitation any ownership, control, or distribution rights.  You understand that the Rights Holder shall be free to solicit other funding for the Campaign, enter into contracts for the Campaign, and otherwise direct the Campaign in its sole discretion. You further understand that nothing in this Agreement or otherwise limits Unglue.it's right to enter into agreements or business relationships relating to Campaigns. Unglue.it does not guarantee that any Campaign’s goal will be met. Any Rewards offered to you are between you and the Rights Holder only, and Unglue.it does not guarantee that Rewards will be delivered or satisfactory to you. You understand that your pledge may be declined at Unglue.it's sole discretion. Unglue.it does not warrant the use of any Campaign funding or the outcome of any Campaign.</p>

<p>Donations to Campaigns are nonrefundable. Under certain circumstances Unglue.it may, but is under no obligation to, seek the refund of Campaign Funding if a Rights Holder misrepresents the Campaign or misuses the funds.   In the event of a suspended or withdrawn campaign, Pledges will be allowed to expire according to their original time limits.  If a suspended campaign is resolved and reactivated within a Pledge’s time limit, that Pledge will remain active.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that all your Contributions are between you, the Rights Holder, and the Processor only, and that Unglue.it is not responsible for Contribution transactions, including without limitation any personal or payment information you provide to the Processor.</p>

<p>Unglue.it makes no representations regarding the deductibility of any Contribution for tax purposes. Please consult your tax advisor for more information.</p>

<a id="rightsholders"><h3>Campaigns: Additional Terms for Rights Holders</h3></a>

<p>Joining Unglue.it as a Rights Holder is free.  However, we do charge a Sales Commission on the completion of a successful campaign, as well as require Rights Holders to supply a Standard Ebook File at their own expense, as described in a Platform Services Agreement.  Pursuant to the Platform Services Agreement, Gluejar will collect a Sales Commission of 6% on the Gross Licensing Price of successful campaigns.  </p>

<p>The Standard Ebook File referenced in the Platform Service Agreement shall meet the following  set of criteria:</p>
<ul class="terms">

<li>The file shall be compliant where ever reasonable with the QED inspection checklist specified at <a href="http://www.publishinginnovationawards.com/featured/qed">http://www.publishinginnovationawards.com/featured/qed </a> </li>

</ul>

<p>Rights Holders who have executed a Platform Services Agreement may initiate and conduct campaigns, as described in the Rights Holder Tools page at ( <a href="http://unglue.it/rightsholders/">http://unglue.it/rightsholders/</a>.</p>

<p>Unglue.it may release Supporter information to Rights Holders, or invite Supporters to share this information, as needed to fulfill the terms of campaigns.  Rights Holders, agree to treat this information in a manner consistent with the Unglue.it <a href="http://unglue.it/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>Rights Holders are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with their use of the site. In the event a listing is removed from the Service for violating the Terms of Use, all fees paid will be non-refundable, unless in its sole discretion Unglue.it determines that a refund is appropriate.</p>

<p>Rights Holders may initiate refunds at their own discretion. Unglue.it is not responsible for issuing refunds for funds that have been collected by Rights Holders.</p>

<p>Donations and Pledges to campaigns are collected on behalf of Unglue.it by a payment processor such as  PayPal.  Unglue.it makes no guarantees regarding the performance or fairness of Paypal. Additionally, because of occasional failures of some credit cards, Unglue.it cannot guarantee the full receipt of pledged or donated amounts.</p>

<p>Though Unglue.it cannot be held liable for the actions of a Rights Holder, Rights Holders are nevertheless wholly responsible for fulfilling obligations both implied and stated in any campaign listing they create. Unglue.it reserves the right to cancel a campaign, refund all associated members' payments, and cancel all associated members’ pledges at any time for any reason. Unglue.it reserves the right to cancel, interrupt, suspend, or remove a campaign listing at any time for any reason.</p>
