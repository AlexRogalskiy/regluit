	What does this mean for you?  Rights holders are the people who are legally authorized to license works.  This means they're the only people who can run campaigns on Unglue.it.
	
	{{ rightsholder }} may be running a campaign soon, or later, but isn't obligated to.  Want to make that campaign happen?  <a href="https://{{site.domain}}{% url work work_id %}?tab=2">Leave a comment</a> and tell your friends:

	<ul>
		<a href="{% url emailshare 'pledge' %}?next={% url work work_id|urlencode:"" %}"><li>Email it!</li></a>
		<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://{{ site.domain }}{% url work work_id|urlencode:"" %}&text=I%20just%20pledged%20to%20unglue%20{{ title|urlencode }}%20at%20%40unglueit.%20Will%20you%20join%20me%3F"><li>Tweet it!</li></a>
		<a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://{{ site.domain }}{% url work work_id|urlencode:"" %}"><li>Share it on Facebook.</li></a>
		<li>Best idea: talk about it with those you love.</li>
	</ul>

	Make sure {{ rightsholder }} knows how much you want to give this book to the world.
	
	Thanks for your help!
