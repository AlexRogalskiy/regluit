<h2>Rights Holder FAQ/How to launch a campaign</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
	In order to launch a campaign, the rights holder must first sign and submit an Unglue.it Platform Services Agreement. 
	Unglue.it staff will review the credentials of the rights holder and enter it into the system, along with an email address and the username for the person who will use the Unglue.it rights holder tools on behalf of the rights holder.
	If your unglue.it account has been associated with a rights holder, the name and contact address of that rights holder should appear above.
	</li>
	<li>
	The next step for a rights holder is to claim works from the Unglue.it database. Find the work by adding it to you wishlist. 
	On the "details" tab of the work's page, you will find a form that allows you to enter a claim.
	When you enter a claim, you will be asked to agree to terms and conditions, in which you agree that you're making the claim in good faith, and that you can substantiate that you have legal control over rights to the work.
	</li>
</ol>
