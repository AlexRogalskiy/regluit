// I am going to need to draw out the page on a white board and get a sense of how this content wants to be structured for reusability.
// What might I need to look at...
//	rulesets that get reused
//	structure of blocks & nesting
//	sort css file by section or type

//	what's up with all the font sizes?
//	should I encode grid size stuff into variables?

// use extra_head block to minify css better! think about file structure...
