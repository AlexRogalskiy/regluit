// I am going to need to draw out the page on a white board and get a sense of how this content wants to be structured for reusability.
/* What might I need to look at...
	rulesets that get reused
	structure of blocks & nesting
	sitewide content vs. some pages only (break apart into smaller files?)
	sort css file by section/type
	how about the compilation errors? do I need to move static into this directory?
