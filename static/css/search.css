/* search.html and supporter.html both include book_panel.html
   however, some of book_panel's data relies on the work/edition linkage having been established,
   which is not necessarily the case for search results
   we could do lots of logic to test to see if things exist on the search results page and make 
   display choices accordingly
   or we could just suppress display of those elements and not worry about it for now
   so we are, with this stylesheet
   (it must go AFTER book_panel.css so these rules will override those)
   hackish solution ftw!
