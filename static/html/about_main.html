        <b>What if you could</b> give a book to everyone on earth?  Get an ebook and read it on any device, in any format, forever? Give an ebook to your library, for them to share?  Own DRM-free ebooks, legally?  Read free ebooks, and know their creators had been fairly paid?

        At Unglue.it, you can pledge toward creating ebooks that will be legally free, worldwide.  These books have already been traditionally published, but they're stuck: legal restrictions keep you from being able to enjoy and share them.

        Unglue.it gets them unstuck.  We work with authors and publishers to choose a fair licensing fee.  We raise that fee here through crowdfunding: people like you chipping in.  When campaigns succeed, the rights holders get paid, and they issue a free electronic edition under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> license.
