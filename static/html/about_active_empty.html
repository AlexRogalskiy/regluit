        Do you have a <b>book you love so much</b> you'd like to give it to the world?  At Unglue.it, you can.

		We want everyone to be able to read beloved books -- for free, on their favorite devices, worldwide. We also want the book creators to be paid.  Traditionally, readers pay each time they buy a book.  But what if it worked more like public radio?  What if creators got enough money to cover their costs and make their efforts worthwhile, and then the book were free to all?  That's what Unglue.it does.  Creators decide what fee makes sense to them, and then, through campaigns at Unglue.it, people everywhere chip in -- people like you.

    	If <span class="ungluer"></span>'s favorite books had ungluing campaigns running right now, you'd see them here.  Ungluers like <span class="ungluer"></span> could pledge to unglue them, with no risk; their credit cards are only be charged when campaigns succeed.  And when that happens, the books become free for you, and everyone else, to read and share.
