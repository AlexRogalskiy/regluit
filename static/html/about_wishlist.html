        Do you have a <b>book you love so much</b> you'd like to give it to the world?  These are the books that {{ supporter }} wants to give to the world.

    	Of course, {{ supporter }} can't do that, because books are stuck.  Copyright and ebook licensing often makes it illegal for individuals, and even libraries, to share digital books.  DRM makes sharing hard.  At Unglue.it, we respect copyright and pay book creators, while enabling book lovers to share their favorite books with everyone.

        In short, we get books unstuck.  We work with authors and publishers to choose a fair licensing fee.  We raise that fee here through crowdfunding: people like you and {{ supporter }} chipping in.  When campaigns succeed, the rights holders get paid, and they issue a free electronic edition under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> license.  It's like public radio: once donors have covered the station's costs, its programs are free to all.

        What if your favorite book could be free to the world?
